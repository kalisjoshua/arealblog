I am achievement oriented and enjoy helping others reach their goals and be their best self. All challenges are surmountable as long as you correctly work towards the appropriate objectives. Everyone should have a voice and I seek to make sure that no one is minimized in any pursuit of success. I build strong relationships through honesty and openness.

My software engineering background has helped me become a code poet, JavaScript journeyman, Git guru, and RESTful API advocate.
