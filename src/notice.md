### Recruiter, please take notice!

I am not currently looking to entertain any new employment at this time. I appreciate that you think that you know the perfect position for me, but you truly don't. I would really enjoy not having to ask you to never contact me again about some 3, 4, 6, 12, 18, or more month non-JavaScript developer position anywhere in the world.

I will contact the companies that I am interested in, on my own. I am plenty capable of speaking with my future employers on my own and deciding what is the correct decision for my situation.

<!--
I will not commute longer than 30 minutes from home to work. I may ask for relocation expenses. I will only work as a front-end developer in modern(-ish) browsers and on projects that I agree with; so don't bother me if the employer you are peddling is looking to support IE back to version 7 or doesn't acknowledge that pixel-perfect layouts are a myth.

I require full admin rights on the macbook pro I am issued. I will need a 27" Apple Cinema display with Bluetooth keyboard and Magic TrackPad. An optional standing desk would also be nice, but not required. However, if it isn't there at first I will probably ask for it later on; the employer should be forewarned.

Thank you for your time. And in the future if we meet or are in contact please make reference to this so that we can have a laugh.

If you are seeing all of this you are probably a developer and feel some of my pain and can sympathize with the sentiment.
