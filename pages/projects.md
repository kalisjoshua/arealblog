## Projects

Here are some samples of my previous work. The bulk of my programming has been behind user logins but I have tried to open-source as much as possible. Some live sites that I have designed have been made-over, so I keep a screen capture for nostalgia.

  + [Jasper](//github.com/kalisjoshua/Jasper)

    A series of JavaScript challenges which escalate in difficulty.

  + [BrowserSlides](//github.com/kalisjoshua/BrowserSlides)

    Slides presentation framework which I have used for public talks.

  + [Cohort](//github.com/kalisjoshua/Cohort)

    A toy project I created as a project build utility.

  + [Euler](//github.com/kalisjoshua/euler)

    I organized a few developers I know into a group to attack [Project Euler](//projecteuler.net) problems in different languages for competition and comparison.

  + [Jawa](//github.com/kalisjoshua/jawa)

    Working with some legacy code I decided to wrap an API around a library file to provide advanced functionality to it.

  + [Longleet](//github.com/kalisjoshua/longleet)

    A project aimed at exploring HyperMedia API: design, development, and consumption.

  + [hAPIness](//github.com/kalisjoshua/hAPIness)

    An API to access [SmugMug](//smugmug.com) account photos and information.

  + [Gruff](//github.com/kalisjoshua/gruff)

    A plain-text to HTML parser library I made as an exploration into some changes I would like to make to [Markdown](//daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

  + [Sherpa](//github.com/kalisjoshua/sherpa)

    A file watcher helper utility written in NodeJS to watch for changes and execute functions / commands.

  + [AnyGrid](//github.com/kalisjoshua/anygrid.less)

    A very simple CSS grid system inspired by [960](//960.gs) written in LESS.

  + [Lotus](//github.com/kalisjoshua/Lotus-Templating)

    A very early templating library in JavaScript.

  + [Shake](//github.com/kalisjoshua/shake)

    A funny little jQuery plugin I created during a prototype stage of a project.
